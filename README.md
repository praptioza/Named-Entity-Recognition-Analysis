# Named Entity Recognition Analysis

## Overview

ðŸš€ Explore the world of Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Python! This project dives into four popular libraries - NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, and Stanza - to extract named entities from text data. By evaluating their performance on a set of 20 test cases, we gain insights into their accuracy, precision, and recall using micro-averaging. 

âš¡ Spoiler alert: Hugging Face Transformers' NER pipeline steals the show with its top-notch performance.

## Libraries Used

ðŸ”¹ **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for various NLP tasks, including NER.
ðŸ”¹ **spaCy**: Industrial-strength NLP library for Python.
ðŸ”¹ **Hugging Face Transformers**: State-of-the-art NER models based on transformer architectures.
ðŸ”¹ **Stanza**: A collection of accurate and efficient NLP tools.

## Performance Evaluation

The performance of each NER approach is evaluated using micro-averaging to calculate accuracy, precision, and recall. The results for each step are as follows:
